# OpenAI Chatbot ðŸ¤–

> Chatbot creation using OpenAI and Streamlit.

## Running

To run the project first create a new Python environment and activate it. I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for setting the python version that pipenv should use to set up the environment. The command bellow will automatically setup the environment with conda and pipenv:

```shell
make env
```

Now install all the project dependencies:

```shell
make install-all
```

Run streamlit web view using:

```shell
make streamlit
```
